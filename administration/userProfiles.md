## Profiles

A profile denotes a group of users with specific privileges in the system. The system supports profiling of users and by default creates a **System Administrator Profile** from which other profiles are created. 

Profiles store specific users or groups of users with separate roles, e.g., management, pension administration, and others as will be demonstrated in this section.


## Profiles Register

Clicking the **Profiles** link will open the profileâ€™s grid table where profiles created in the system to date are listed. A user can browse through the list, create a new profile, view details of a selected profile and remove a profile from the system as shown in the screenshot below:

-   Click **label 2** button to view the details of a selected profile.

-   Click **label 3** button to delete a selected profile from the system.

-   Click **label 4** button to save a copy of the profile register.
  

## Creating a New Profile

Clicking the **New Profile** tab will open a dialogue box. Through this, a new profile can be created by providing the profile name and a description as shown below:

## Enabling Profile Permissions

Once a profile is created, the next step is to allow access to certain sub-functions in the system to a newly created profile. The permissions given enable the new profile to access system modules and rights to certain functions in an
individual module.


## Profile Permissions

Clicking the **Profile Permissions** link will open the profiles permission grid table where permissions are assigned to profiles. The table provides drop-down menus to choose profiles and the modules whose permissions are to be assigned to
a profile among others as shown below:

### Enabling Permissions

After clicking the **Filter** button, a grid table listing all **Permissions** in a selected Module will be displayed. Select Permission from the list and click the **Enable** button to activate the sub-functions in that Profile. Otherwise, click the **Disable** button to deactivate a Permission.
