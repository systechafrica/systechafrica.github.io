### Notifications

FundMaster communicates, internally and externally, through an advanced notification system using emails, SMS, or both. The system allows an administrator to configure a notification matrix (i.e., what key system activities need notifications) and set up email templates for sending messages to the target audience concerning issues such as password reset alerts.


## Notifications Config Matrix

Clicking the **Notifications** link labeled 3, will display a drop-down menu from which the **Notifications Config Matrix** link is accessed. Click this link to display a **Send Notifications on?** form where a user is allowed to select the key events and activities for which notification messages ought to be sent.

Check the **Yes** or **No** checkbox on the listed items enclosed under label 1, otherwise, choose whether to make the configurations global or not under the text box labeled 2 as shown in the screenshot below:

**Action**

-   Tick the appropriate checkbox â€“ **Yes** or **No** under the encloser **labeled 1** to determine which action to send notification.

-   Select **Yes** or **No** in the drop-down menu **labeled 2** to determine the scope of application of the configurations.

-   Click the **Save** button to confirm the configurations, otherwise close the form.
  

## Notification Templates

The system allows administrators to design notifications templates in such a way that instead of writing a notification to every recipient individually, keywords e.g., member name, member number etc. are dynamically embedded in a message from the database to enable sending of a copy to a list of members in a click. See a grid table listing available templates on the screenshot below:

**Action**

-   Click **label 1** button to add a new template

-   Click **label 2** button to view the details of a selected template

-   Click **label 3** button to delete a selected template from the system
  

Clicking the **New** button will open a dialogue box where a new email notification template can be configured as shown below:

**Tip**

- Make use of reserved keywords by selecting them from the drop-down box menu located above the message body and use then inside the message as shown above.
