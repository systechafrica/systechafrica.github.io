## Introduction

The reports module provides a separate interface for accessing every report generated across all modules in FundMaster by aggregating the reports under one dashboard. The aim is to ensure quick, easy one-stop exclusive accessibility to system users.  Technically, this also enables deployment of reports on another instance of server thus reducing the amount of stress on the main application, making it more efficient.
