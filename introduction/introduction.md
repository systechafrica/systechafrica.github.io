### System Modules

Conceptually, FundMaster Xe adopts a “Top-down design;” a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent interchangeable modules such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality. Each module enforces logical boundaries and is incorporated into the FundMaster Xe system through interfaces detectable by other modules. It is on this platform that the business process flow is implemented.

The system integrates the following supporting modules for efficacy:

-	**The administrative panel:** This module aids in the management of rights and permissions access through the creation of profiles and user accounts.

-	**Scheme setup module:** this module aids in the implementation or setting up of the Trust Deed and Rules of a pension scheme.
	
-	**Member Register:** The member register is a container that holds pension scheme active and inactive (deferred) members.

-	**Pensioner Register:** The pensioners’ register is a container that holds pension scheme pensioners and their related beneficiaries.

-	**Accounting Module:** The Accounting module manages the financial records and their related reports of a pension scheme.

-	**Investments module:** The investments module manages the various investment asset classes or categories of a pension scheme.

-	**Fees and commissions:** This module help in the management of administrative services fees and agency services commissions.

-	**Workflow management module:** This module aids in the distribution of the systems core processes by routing tasks to the responsible users through a sequential progression of work activities.
