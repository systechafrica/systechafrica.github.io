## The Module Concept

Conceptually, FundMaster Xe adopts a “Top-down design”; a software design
technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into
independent interchangeable modules such that each contains everything necessary
to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality. Each module enforces
logical boundaries and is incorporated into the FundMaster Xe system through
interfaces detectable by other modules. It is on this platform that the business
process flow is implemented.

The system integrates the following supporting modules for efficacy:

-   **The administrative panel:** This module helps in the management of rights
    and permissions access through the creation of profiles and user accounts.

-   **Scheme setup module:** basically, helps in the implementation or setting
    up of the Trust Deed and Rules of a pension scheme.

-   **Member Register:** The member register is a container that holds pension
    scheme active and inactive (deferred) members.

-   **Pensioner Register:** The pensioners register is a container that holds
    pension scheme pensioners and their related beneficiaries.

-   **Accounting Module:** The Accounting module manages the financial records
    and their related reports of a pension scheme.

-   **Investments module:** The investments module manages the various
    investments asset classes or categories of a pension scheme.

-   **Fees and commissions:** This module help in the management of
    administrative services fees and agency services commissions.

-   **Workflow management module:** This module aids in the distribution of the
    systems core processes by routing of tasks to the responsible users through
    sequential progression of work activities.
