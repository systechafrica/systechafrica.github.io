## **Pension Payroll**
FundMaster Pension Payroll is designed in such a way that a user can verify, validate, and push the payroll for payment processing. FundMaster payroll has the capability of performing the following functions automatically:

1. Receipt of pension payroll records e.g., eligible pensioners.
1. Gross pay calculation.
1. Calculation of pensioner’s deductions, taxes and subtracting them from gross pay.
1. Calculation of arrears to eligible pensioners which are computed automatically and paid in the next payroll or as a lump sum.
1. Recoveries of liabilities from monthly pension.

### **Prerequisites**
- Pensioners bank details should be up to date.
- All pensioners' Tax pins should be up to date or set as non-mandatory in the account’s configuration setup.
- All deductions if any have been added.

Prior to running pension payroll, the system runs validation checks to identify gaps that might cause balancing issues.
