### Switching Scheme

After successfully approving a newly created scheme, one can go ahead and make it the **Working Scheme**. This is done by switching from the current scheme to the new scheme. This will allow a scheme administrator to continue setting up other configurations for the new scheme.

To switch schemes, first navigate back to the **Admin Panel links** window and click **Existing Users** as shown in the following screenshot:
