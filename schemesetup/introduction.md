### Scheme Setup Module

The Scheme Setup module implements the trust deed and rules of a scheme. These are implemented in the system through configurations such as Basic Scheme Details, Contribution Rates, Vesting Scales, Schemes Member Classes, Reasons for
Exit, Interest Formula, Interest Rates, B+enefits Configuration Matrix, End Year Parameters, Pension Setup Parameters, etc.
