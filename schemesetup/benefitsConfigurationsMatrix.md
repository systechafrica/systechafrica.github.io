    example is illustrated below:

    *Interpolate the factor for an exit aged 55 years 5months, given the following factor table:*

| **Age** | **Factor** |
|---------|------------|
| 51      | 12.85      |
| 52      | 12.90      |

**= (12.85 + (5/12 \*0.1)) 12.89**

-   **Allow withdrawals in active service?** Specify whether the scheme trust deed and rules allow active member to withdraw from the scheme by checking the check box on this option.
