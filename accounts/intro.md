### Accounts Module

The accounting module enables configurations for seamless integration of the accounting package, with capabilities to handle straight-through processing for Receipting and Payments from all the other modules. For example, all contribution receipts and benefit payments are seamlessly posted to General Ledger, and financials are prepared in real-time.

Among the key configurations done in this module includes functionalities such as accounts receivables, accounts payables, cash management, asset management, general ledger, and budgeting. Other settings done in the module are user-definable and flexible chart of accounts, general ledger to record all the financial transactions, mapping of fund processes to their specific general ledger accounts, bank reconciliation, and cash management, financial periods, company's budget, fixed assets, statutory payments, financial journals, exchange rates, intercompany transaction register, and Staff Payroll.
